# Hospital Database System #
## This project simulates a real-life hospital's database ##

### Overview

  * Cities and districts that are red-zoned
  * People that were in contact with the infected patients and more!
This repository also includes a detailed Entity-Relationship diagram to depict fully how hospital entities relate <br/>
